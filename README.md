# Live Face Detection 👤📷

This is my mini project where I used **OpenCV Haar Cascade Classifier** to detect faces in real-time using the webcam.  
When I run the program, it opens my camera and draws a **green rectangle** around any detected face.  



## 🚀 Features
- Real-time face detection using webcam
- Detects multiple faces at once
- Highlights faces with bounding boxes
- Simple and fast using Haar Cascade model


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- OpenCV (cv2)
